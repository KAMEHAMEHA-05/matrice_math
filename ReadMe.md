## PYTHON PACKAGE : MATRICE_MATH
****
The Matrice_math package facilitates fundamental mathematical operations on matrices and determinants. It supports a range of operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication (both matrix and scalar), and provides functionalities for computing the minor, cofactor, adjoint, determinant, and inverse of a given matrix

#### INSTALLATION
Installation can be done in the following 3 methods :

1. Command Prompt : 
    * Type in `pip install matrix_math`
2. PyPi :
