## PYTHON PACKAGE : MATRIX_MATH
****
Matrix_math is a package that can be used to perform basic computing processes on any sort of matrix or determinant, which include addition, subtraction, multiplication(matrix and scalar), as well as calculating the minor, cofactor, adjoint, determinant and inverse of a given matrix

#### INSTALLATION
Installation can be done in the following 3 methods :

1. Command Prompt : 
    * Type in `pip install matrix_math`
2. PyPi :
    * Open [link](https://pypi.org/) in and browser and install
3. Github :
    * Open [link](https://github.com/) in and browser and install

_**If you are using method 2 or method 3, paste the installed repository in your site_packages folder**_

#### FUNCTIONS
This package contains the following functions which can be used after importing by `import matrix_math` :

1. Addition of two matrices :
    * `matrix_math.add(matrix_1, matrix_2)`
2. Subtraction of two matrices :
    * `matrix_math.subtract(matrix_1, matrix_2)`
3. Muliplication of two matrices :
    * `matrix_math.matrix_mult(matrix_1, matrix_2)`
4. Scalar multiplication :
    * `matrix_math.scalar_mult(number, matrix)`
5. Minor of a certain index in a matrix :
    * `matrix_math.minor(matrix, (i,j))`
6. Cofactor of a certain index in a matrix :
    * `matrix_math.cofactor(matrix, (i,j))`
7. Minor matrix of a given matrix :
    * `matrix_math.minor_mat(matrix)`
8. Cofactor matrix of a given matrix :
    * `matrix_math.cofactor_mat(matrix)`
9. Transpose of a given matrix :
    * `matrix_math.transpose(matrix)`
10. Adjoin of a given matrix :
    * `matrix_math.adjoint(matrix)`
11. Determinant of a given matrix :
    * `matrix_math.determinant(matrix)`
12. Inverse of a given matrix :
    * `matrix_math.inverse(matrix)`
